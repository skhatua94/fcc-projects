     </h2>
      <p>At age 18, Mother Teresa enrolled herself at the Institute of the Blessed Mary Virgin and became a nun. She took her very first religious vows in 1931. She taught at St. Mary's School after that. She created a religious community called Missionaries of Charity Sisters. She believed God asked her to do this. Their mission was to help those who were very sick and poor.</p>
    
    <h2><u>Charity</u></h2>
    <p>Mother Teresa created a school that became a home for those in very poor health. She also established the Missionaries of Charity. She also opened a home for orphans and homeless youths called Children's Home of the Immaculate Heart. Missionaries of Charity eventually created numerous hospices, orphanges, and leper houses all over India.</p>
